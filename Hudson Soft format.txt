Song pointer table
===================
The song pointer table is comprised of 16-bit (2-byte) pointers to each song. This table only stores music rather than sound effects. The table can be found using the following code:
	add a
	ld c, a
	ld b, $0
	ld hl, SongHeaderPointers1
	add hl, bc
	ld e, [hl]
	inc hl
	ld h, [hl]
	ld l, e
	ld e, [hl]
	inc hl
	ld b, h
	ld c, l
	rr e
Which equals the following in hex:
87 4F 06 00 21 ?? ?? 09 5E 23 66 6B 5E 23 44 4D CB 1B

Song headers
===================
Headers for each song are structured as follows:
1. Channel mask (0000 abcd) - only the lower 4 bits are used?
    d = Channel 1
    c = Channel 2
    b = Channel 3
    a = Channel 4
2-3. Channel pointer (Repeat for every channel)

Commands
===================
Song channel patterns are structured using the following commands:
xy (00-CF) = Play note, length (0 = Rest)
D0 xx = Set channel speed
Dx (X = 1-6) = Set octave
D7 = Increase octave
D8 = Decrease octave
D9 = Toggle note "tie" mode on/off
DA xx = ?
DB = ?
DC xy = Set stereo panning (X = L, Y = R, 0 = false, 1 = true)
DD = Song loop point
DE = Go to loop point
DF xx = Repeat the following section X times
E0 = End of repeated section
E1 xx = ?
E2 xxxx = Go to macro
E3 = Return from macro
E4 xx = Set frequency
E5 xx = Set duty
E6 xy = Set volume envelope
E7 xx = Set waveform
E8 xx = Set note cut-off
E9 xx = Set echo effect
EA xx = Set vibrato type
EB xx = Set vibrato delay
EC xx = Set pitch offset
ED xx = Adjust pitch offset
EE = ?
F0 xx = Preset
F1 xx = ?
F2 = ?
F3 = ?
F4 = ?
F5-F9 = Unused?
FA = ?
FB = ?
FC = ?
FD = ?
FE = ?
FF = End of channel
